# #### Make the Deadfish Swim

Write a simple parser that will parse and run Deadfish.

Deadfish has 4 commands, each 1 character long:

-   `i` increments the value (initially `0`)
-   `d` decrements the value
-   `s` squares the value
-   `o` outputs the value into the return array

Invalid characters should be ignored.

**Example**

```js 
parse("iiisdoso") => [ 8, 64 ]
```

## Solution
